Uploading Slider Images

- Go to root directory of the project and open script.js file
- On top of the file you’ll find section for defining several constants
- Find “Define the images for the slider” section
- Before changing the image links go to assets folder and copy all the images you need for the slider into that folder.
- Naming conventions for the images should be h1.jpg, h2.jpg, h3.jpg etc (jpg format is recommended)
- After copying and renaming the images into required format within assets folder, go back to script.js into the section declared above and follow the format as described there.
- with src attribute just change the name of the image if is h1, h2, h3 … etc also update the alt attribute to match the image number. For example if src =“./assets/h8.jpg” alt should be “Slide 8”
